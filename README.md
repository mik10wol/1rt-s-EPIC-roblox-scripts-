### PLEASE READ BLELOW BEFORE RUNNING!
this script isnt instant but gets the job done and is extremly simple.
If you run the script in the lobby and load into tbe game you will wonder why the player's are not hiligted yet. this is becuse mm2 does not have teams, so instead the script waits for a player to take out their tool (knife or gun) and then hilights them. the gun drop one is instant though. This script still runs if you die or others die so you only need to run it once!

loadstring
```lua
loadstring("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mik10wol/1rt-s-EPIC-roblox-scripts-/refs/heads/main/mm2ESP.lua")
```

### PLEASE READ BLELOW BEFORE RUNNING!
for this script you will need some extra stuff. where it says local user = "Roblox". type in the "" your targets USERNAME!!! i cant stress this enough type in THE USERNAME NOT DISPLAYNAME! it also must be exact. the script will always be running even if you die or your target does.

loadstring and more
```Lua
local user = "Roblox"
loadstring("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mik10wol/1rt-s-EPIC-roblox-scripts-/refs/heads/main/freindLocator.lua")
```

## Q and A

### i have an issue.
use the issue feature if your stuck!

## loadstrings are not working.
type in chat /console of click F9 and see if there is an error that has something to do with HTTPS requests. if you find it: click the green code button on this site then click the zip icon then accsept the download and unzip your folder to a location. go to your 'roblox studio' and click run script or something like that and find the location of the script you want then run it and boom! (does not work for user locator)

## nothing happens when i load/run the scipt.
type in chat /console of click F9 and see if there is an error that has something to do with HTTPS requests. if you find it do the above questions awnser. if you run the sript and there are no errors check your 'roblox studio' is up-to-date. if all fails go to the issue feature on gitub and say whats wrong.

## i want to 'roblox studio' but i dont know where to start
go to the [we are devs]("https://wearedevs.net/d/JJSploit") and download *__it__*, *__it__* may seem like a virus but this is by far one of the most safe *__ones__* out there.

put gif here.
