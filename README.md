### PLEASE READ BLELOW BEFORE RUNNING!
this script isnt instant but gets the job done and is extremly simple.
If you run the script in the lobby and load into tbe game you will wonder why the player's are not hiligted yet. this is becuse mm2 does not have teams, so instead the script waits for a player to take out their tool (knife or gun) and then hilights them. the gun drop one is instant though. This script still runs if you die or others die so you only need to run it once!

### PLEASE READ BLELOW BEFORE RUNNING!
for this script you will need to copy and paste or download and edit. where it says local user = "Roblox". type in the "" your targets USERNAME!!! i cant stress this enough type in THE USERNAME NOT DISPLAYNAME! it also must be exact. the script will always be running even if you die or your target does.

### PLEASE READ BELOW BEFORE RUNNING!
To place a block press l. the block will spawn where you are, wait 3 seconds for it to solidify.

## Q and A

### i have an issue.
use the issue feature if your stuck!

### nothing happens when i load/run the scipt.
type in chat /console of click F9 and see if there is an error, if you run the sript and there are no errors check your 'roblox studio' is up-to-date. if all fails go to the issue feature on gitub and say whats wrong.

## i want to 'roblox studio' but i dont know where to start
go to the https://wearedevs.net/d/JJSploit and download *__it__*, *__it__* may seem like a virus but this is by far one of the most safe *__ones__* out there.
